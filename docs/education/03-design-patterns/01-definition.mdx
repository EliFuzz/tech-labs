    Well-described solution to the most commonly encountered problems which occur during software development.

    **Dependency Injection**

    Dependency injection makes it easy to create loosely coupled components, which typically means that components consume functionality defined by interfaces without having any first-hand knowledge of which implementation classes are being used.

    **Inversion of Control**

    Pattern used for decoupling components and layers in the system

    ```java
        public class TextEditor {
            private SpellChecker checker;
            public TextEditor() { this.checker = new SpellChecker(); }
        }

        // IoC
        public class TextEditor {
            private IocSpellChecker checker;
            public TextEditor(IocSpellChecker checker) { this.checker = checker; }
        }
        // You have inverted control by handing the responsibility of instantiating the spell checker from the TextEditor class to the caller
        SpellChecker sc = new SpellChecker; // dependency
        TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(sc);
    ```

    - **Abstract Class**: A blueprint for other classes to inherit from, often containing common methods and properties
    - **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details
    - **Aggregation Hierarchy**: A structure that organizes classes based on their aggregation relationships, forming a hierarchy of dependencies
    - **Aggregation**: A relationship where one class contains references to other classes, but the referenced classes can exist independently
    - **Association**: A relationship between classes where one class is related to another, typically indicating a usage or dependency
    - **Attribute**: A characteristic or property that describes an object
    - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that defines their structure and behavior
    - **Cohesion**: The degree to which the elements within a module belong together and work together towards a common purpose
    - **Collaboration**: Interaction among objects to achieve a common goal, often involving passing messages between objects
    - **Composition**: A stronger form of aggregation where the contained objects are part of the whole and have a lifecycle dependent on the container
    - **Concrete Class**: A class that can be instantiated to create objects directly
    - **Coupling**: The degree of interdependence between modules or classes within a system
    - **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, hiding the internal state of an object from the outside
    - **Information Hiding**: Restricting access to certain parts of an object, protecting its internal details from external interference
    - **Inheritance Hierarchy**: A structure that organizes classes based on their inheritance relationships, forming a hierarchy of specialization
    - **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior from an existing class
    - **Instance**: A specific realization of a class, representing a unique object in memory
    - **Instantiate**: Creating an instance of a class, allocating memory for the object and initializing its properties
    - **Interface**: A set of methods that define the behavior expected from a class, providing a contract for how a class should interact with the outside world
    - **Message**: Communication between objects, often invoking a method on another object
    - **Messaging**: The process of sending and receiving messages between objects to achieve desired behaviors -
    - **Multiple Inheritance**: A feature in some programming languages where a class can inherit properties and behavior from multiple parent classes
    - **Multiplicity**: The cardinality of relationships, indicating how many instances of one class are associated with instances of another clas
    - **Object Space Database**: A database system that stores objects rather than traditional rows and columns
    - **Object**: An instance of a class representing a unique entity with its own state and behavior
    - **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes representing real-world entities. OOP focuses on organizing code into modular units (objects) that encapsulate data and behavior. It promotes concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to create reusable and maintainable code
    - **Operation**: A function or method that can be performed on an object
    - **Override**: Providing a new implementation for a method inherited from a superclass in a subclass
    - **Pattern**: A reusable solution to a common problem in software design
    - **Persistence**: The ability of data to outlast the execution of the program, typically achieved through storage in databases or files
    - **Persistent Object**: An object whose state is stored beyond the lifetime of the program execution
    - **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or any of its subclasses
    - **Single Inheritance**: A restriction where a class can inherit properties and behavior from only one parent class
    - **Stereotype**: A fixed idea or image of a particular type of person or thing, often used in the context of classifying objects or behaviors
    - **Subclass**: A class that inherits properties and behavior from a superclass
    - **Superclass**: A class from which other classes inherit properties and behavior
    - **Transient Object**: An object that exists temporarily and is not stored permanently
