            ## 4 pillars

            - **Individuals over processes and tools** (people over processes): Prioritizes team collaboration over rigid procedures
            - **Working software over comprehensive documentation** (functional software over docs): Values working software over extensive documentation
            - **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** (customer collaboration over contracts): Emphasizes customer involvement in shaping software
            - **Responding to change over following a plan** (adaptation over adherence): Enables quick adjustments to plans over strict adherence to initial plans

            ## 12 principles

            - **Satisfy customers early and continuously**: Regular updates make customers happier and boost revenue
            - **Embrace changing requirements**: Agile thrives on adaptability, rigid plans hinder progress
            - **Deliver value frequently**: Regular delivery reduces customer churn
            - **Break project silos**: Collaboration enhances Agile effectiveness
            - **Motivate team members**: Agile success hinges on committed teams
            - **Prioritize face-to-face communication**: Direct communication fosters better understanding
            - **Focus on working software**: Functionality is the primary progress indicator
            - **Maintain sustainable pace**: Avoid burnout by balancing speed and sustainability
            - **Pursue continuous excellence**: Build on past successes for future efficiency
            - **Embrace simplicity**: Avoid overcomplicating solutions
            - **Empower self-organizing teams**: Proactive teams drive value creation
            - **Reflect and adjust regularly**: Adaptation enhances effectiveness through retrospective meetings

            ## Use cases

            - Most companies typically don't adhere to all principles or procedures, thus each company adopts its own version of "Lean Agile" that best suits their needs

            ## Finance

            - **Calculate Project Costs**: Estimating project costs involves determining the budget required for team salaries, equipment, licenses, and other resources needed for product delivery. This is done collaboratively by the Scrum Team during Sprint Planning
            - **Select Project Investments**: Product Owner prioritizes investments in the Product Backlog based on factors like market demand, customer feedback, and return on investment. Decision-making between buying and building solutions occurs during Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective meetings
                - **The Payback Period**: Time taken for a project to recoup its initial investment is assessed based on the frequency of delivering product increments, potentially shorter due to incremental value delivery
                - **Buy Versus Build**: Choice between purchasing external solutions or developing in-house is made considering factors like time to market, customization needs, and long-term strategic goals
                - **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Is evaluated for each product increment, comparing the present value of expected benefits with development costs. This guides prioritization in the Product Backlog
                - **Internal Rate of Return (IRR), or Return on Investment (ROI)**: Profitability of features is assessed by comparing benefits with development costs, aiding prioritization decisions during Sprint Reviews
            - **Monitor Project Performance**
                - **Cost Performance**: Development Team tracks actual costs during Sprints, and the Scrum Master facilitates discussions to address budgetary concerns and deviations from the planned budget
                - **Schedule Performance**: Progress is monitored using Sprint and Release Burndown Charts. Delays or impediments are addressed in Daily Scrums and Sprint Retrospectives to ensure project timelines are met
                - **Project Budget Forecasting**: Future costs are estimated collaboratively by the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team based on velocity, scope changes, and uncertainties. Regular reviews ensure accuracy and inform resource adjustments

            ## Values:

            - **Commitment**: Dedication to Sprint and project goals (ensures alignment and motivates high-quality delivery)
                - Team, Product Owner, and Scrum Master commitment
            - **Courage**: Willingness to tackle challenges and take risks (fosters innovation, resilience, and continuous improvement)

          ## Visualization

          | To-Do | In Progress | Done  |
          |-------|-------------|-------|
          | Task1 | Task2       | Task3 |
          | Task4 | Task5       |       |
          | Task6 |             |       |

          ## Principles

             - **Start with what you do now**: Begin with the existing workflow, making gradual changes over time
             - **Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change**: Aim for small, continuous improvements instead of drastic changes
             - **Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles**: Acknowledge the value in current systems and improve on them without discarding them
             - **Encourage acts of leadership at all levels**: Foster shared responsibility and continuous learning by promoting leadership at all levels

          ## Practices

             - **Visualize the workflow**: Use a Kanban board to map out work items and their status for transparency and understanding
             - **Limit work in progress (WIP)**: Focus on task completion by limiting ongoing tasks, reducing multitasking and improving productivity
             - **Flow Management**: Monitor and manage the pace and smoothness of work
             - **Making Policies Explicit**: Make all process-related rules visible to all team members
             - **Implement Feedback Loops**: Regular meetings to review work and discuss ways to improve
             - **Collaborative or Experimental Evolution**: Experiment with processes and learn from the results collectively
             - **Understanding the principles: Case Studies and Examples**: Provide insights into the principles and examples in action

          ## Kanban board

          Kanban boards are visual tools for managing workflow. Each column represents a stage of work, with cards representing individual tasks. They help improve workflow transparency, limit work in progress, and improve efficiency.

          Basic Kanban boards have 3 columns: **To-Do** (new tasks), **In-Progress** (tasks being worked on), and **Done** (completed tasks).

          Kanban cards are visual tools used in the Kanban system to track work progress. Their main purpose is to ensure a smooth workflow and limit WIP.

          ## Implementing WIP Limits

          - WIP limits prevent overloading, promote focus, and highlight bottlenecks in the workflow
          - To set WIP limits, consider team capacity, work nature, and goals. Adjust based on team feedback and historical data
          - WIP limits enhance productivity by reducing multitasking and context switching. They improve efficiency by making bottlenecks visible
          - WIP limits should be regularly reviewed and adjusted based on team capacity and business priorities
