          Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a decentralized network model where nodes, or "peers", connect directly to each other instead of via a central server. Each peer shares resources like processing power or storage, enabling efficient and flexible data distribution

                ## Versioning

                - **URL Path**: `test.com/v1/users`
                - **URL Query**: `/users?version=1.0`
                - **Header** (or as a custom header): `curl -H "Accept: application/json; version=1.0" test.com/users`
                - **Body**: `curl test.com/users -d "{version: 1.0}"`

                ## Resource Naming Convention

                - **URL Path and URL Query Parameters**: Consider using hyphens (`-`) to separate words in your URLs, as it helps users and search engines identify concepts in the URL more easily
                    - `/users/very-long-path?long-text=123`
                - **camelCase**
                    - `/users/veryLongPath?longText=123`

                ## Nouns vs Verbs

                - Verbs should not be used in endpoint paths. Instead, the pathname should contain the nouns that identify the object that the endpoint that we are accessing or altering belongs to.
                    - Instead of using `/getAllClients` to fetch all clients, use `/clients`

                ## Singular vs Plural

                - Stick to one convention because it depends on your domain
                    - as an example
                        - **shopping cart** in e-commerce website is **1-to-1** relationship between client and a shopping cart. Therefore, it's confusing to have `/carts`
                        - on the other hand, we can have a **blog** with **articles** which makes more sense to have `/articles` endpoint

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                ## Proper Error Handling

                - Do not expose any sensitive information
                - Wrap any API calls and return only predefined messages for `4xx`, `5xx`
                - Implement global Exception and provide Default Response Entity
                    - HTTP Code 400: Provide only client's oriented message
                    - HTTP Code 500: Log the error and provide generic message
                - Standardize response body

                  ```json
                  {
                      "timestamp":"2000-01-15T22:00:00.000+0000",
                      "status":500,
                      "error":"Internal Server Error",
                      "message":"Error while processing request",
                      "path":"/api/user/1"
                  }
                  ```

                ## Response Entity

                - Don’t return plain text responses
                - In most cases REST APIs should accept JSON for request payload and also respond with JSON because it is a standard for transferring data

                ## Data Filtering

                - use URL params
                    - **filter**: `GET /users?country=US&city=NY`
                    - **sorting**: `GET /users?sort=name:asc`
                    - **paging**:
                        - **offset/limit**: `GET /users?offset=3&limit=120`
                            - slower solution because it process **x** rows and then return **y** rows
                            - **OFFSET 90000 LIMIT 10**: read 90010 rows and then return only 10 rows
                        - **cursor/token**: `GET /users?cursor=12345`
                            - more efficient solution especially for large datasets
                            - **token**: any column or property that is used to pivot through the data in the table. Most common is `created_at` column
                            - **improve performance**: index column that is used to pivot through the data in the table (cursor/token column)
                            - **WHERE created_at >= "2024-01-01" LIMIT 10**: filter through the table and read only 10 required rows

                ## Utilize Resource Nesting Efficiency

                - If resource have a **has-a** relationship to another resource it's good to use **nesting** while implementing REST API Contracts
                    - Example: user can have some orders in e-commerce website
                        - **user's orders**: `/users/1/orders/`
                        - **user's order**: `/users/1/orders/1`

                ## Security

                - Use SSL/TLS for secure communication
                - Add secured short-lived headers
                    - **JWT Token**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
                    - **CORS**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: your.domain.com`
                - Root Certificate
                - Rate Limiting
                    - Design rate limiting rules based on **user**, **IP**, **action group**, etc.

                ## Async Logging

                - send logs to a lock-free ring buffer and return
                - flush to the disk periodically
                - higher throughput and lower latency

                ## Caching

                - store frequently accessed data in the cache instead of database
                - query database when there is a cache miss

                ## Payload Compression

                - use gzip
                - reduce the data size to speed up the download/upload

                ## Connection Pool

                - opening and closing DB connections add significant overhead
                - connection pool maintains a number of open connections for applications to reuse

                ## Request Body

                This pattern is well-suited for any messaging protocols and data formats. Including but not limited to REST, Pub-Sub

                ```json
                {
                    "specversion" : "1.0",
                    "type" : "com.github.pull_request.closed",
                    "source" : "https://github.com/spec/pull",
                    "subject" : "123",
                    "id" : "5f9eab6f-3d1f-4d0f-bd6d-9a8c6c8c6c6c",
                    "time" : "2020-01-15T22:00:00Z",
                    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
                    "data" : "{ "user": { "id": 1, "name": "John" } }"
                }
                ```

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                          <td>In event-driven systems, the event subject, tied to the event producer, helps subscribers filter relevant events. This is crucial in scenarios where middleware lacks data interpretation capability. For instance, a subscriber may only want to receive events related to certain blob names, like those ending in *.jpg* or *.jpeg*. The subject attribute aids in constructing efficient filters. For example, a subscriber might be interested in new blob creations within a storage container, where the event source denotes the container, the type indicates the event, and the ID distinguishes between occurrences of similarly named blobs. The subject field carries the name of the newly created blob</td>
