            <TabItem value="sync-retry-patterns" label="Retry Patterns">
                ### Patterns

                - **Cancel**: User can cancel the request
                - **Immediate retry**: User immediately resends a request
                - **Incremental intervals**: User waits for a short time for the first retry, and then incrementally increases the time for subsequent retries
                - **Exponential Backoff**: Retry after waiting doubled from previous attempt (1s, 2s, 4s...)
                - **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: Adds randomness to waiting times to prevent retries from all hitting the server at once

                ### Cons

                - Degrade/Overload the system
                - Idempotency consideration (operation that produces the same outcome for the same input)
                - Retry amplification (retries aren't always needed)

                ### Solutions

                - Rate limiting
                - Circuit breakers

                ### Semantic Versioning

                **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: (`1.0.0`)

                - `MAJOR`: version for incompatible contract changes
                - `MINOR`: version for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner
                - `PATCH`: version for backward-compatible bug fixes

                ### Considerations

                - **Trade-offs**: Complexity vs Flexibility, Backward vs Forward Compatibility
                - **Start simple**: Opt for schema versioning or backward-compatible evolution for most cases
                - **Use content negotiation**: For highly dynamic environments with diverse clients
                - **Versioning granularity**: Decide if versioning applies to entire messages or individual fields
                - **Version deprecation policy**: Define a timeline for removing support for older versions
                - **Versioning tooling**: Leverage tools for schema documentation, validation, and migration
                - **Clear communication**: Document versioning policies and notify stakeholders of upcoming changes
                - **Forsee Future Changes**: Plan for message versioning to accommodate future changes in the payload structure, and ensure backward and forward compatibility to facilitate system evolution

            <TabItem value="async-communication-channels" label="Communication Channels">
                - **Identify Use Cases**:
                    - Processing large data sets
                    - Triggering workflows
                    - Sending notifications
                    - Real-time communication
                - **Message Routing and Filtering**
                    - Topic-based vs Queue-based Routing
                    - Content-Based Routing
                    - Filtering Techniques (Header, Metadata, Content)
                - **Messaging Pattern**
                    - **Point-to-Point (P2P)**: Messages are delivered from a single producer to a single consumer. Ideal for one-off tasks or directed communication
                    - **Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)**: Messages are published to a topic, and any interested subscribers receive them. Great for real-time updates and broadcasting information
                    - **Request-Reply**:  Similar to synchronous communication, but with a delayed response to handle long-running tasks
                - **Messaging Technology**
                    - **Message Queues (MQ)**: Robust and reliable, offering features like message persistence, retries, and guaranteed delivery (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS)
                    - **Streaming Platforms (Apache Kafka)**: Handle high-volume, real-time data pipelines with low latency
                    - **Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets**:  Enable bi-directional communication for real-time web applications

                ### Naming

                - **Abbreviation Standards**: Define a clear abbreviation policy for common elements (`prod` for production)
                - **Case Sensitivity**: Decide on case sensitivity (uppercase, lowercase, mixed) for consistency
                - **Namespace Separation**: Utilize separators (hyphen `-`, underscore `_`) to differentiate between elements clearly
                - **Naming Length**: Maintain a reasonable length to avoid excessive complexity
                - **Structure**: `{base_resource}.{environment}.{application}.{functionality}[.{version}]` (`queue.prod.order-processing.payment-confirmation.v2`)
                    - **Base Resource**: Identify the top-level resource category (`queue`, `topic`, `exchange`)
                    - **Environment**: Indicate the deployment environment (`dev`, `test`, `prod`)
                    - **Domain/Product/Application**: Specify the entity using the resource (`order-processing`, `user-service`)
                    - **Functionality**: Describe the specific functionality of the resource (`payment-confirmation`, `user-registration`)
                    - **Versioning Strategy**: Establish a versioning approach to denote changes (semantic versioning)
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem value="async-resource-naming-convention" label="Resource Naming Convention">
                - **Abbreviations**: Use abbreviations judiciously for commonly used terms, but ensure clarity for less familiar ones
                - **Clarity and Consistency**: Use clear and concise names that accurately reflect the field's purpose
                - **Domain-Specificity**: Use terminology relevant to the specific domain the message applies to
                - **Extensibility**: Design messages to be easily extensible for future requirements
                - **Generic Terms**: Avoid generic terms like "data" or "value" unless their meaning is self-evident
                - **Hierarchical Structure**: If necessary, use a hierarchical structure for nested data
                - **Immutability**: Prefer immutable message fields to maintain data integrity
                - **Maintain consistent naming conventions**: Use consistent naming throughout the system (`camelCase`, `snake_case`)
                - **Message Format**: Define a clear and consistent message format (JSON, Protobuf)
                - **Metadata Fields**: Incorporate metadata fields for tracking message processing (`retry_count`, `status`, `error_details`)
                - **Payload Structure**: Design payload structure to encapsulate data relevant to the specific use case

                ###  Common Fields

                ### URL

                - **URL Path and URL Query Parameters**: Consider using hyphens (`-`) to separate words in your URLs, as it helps users and search engines identify concepts in the URL more easily
                    - `/users/very-long-path?long-text=123`
                - **camelCase**
                    - `/users/veryLongPath?longText=123`

                ### Nouns vs Verbs

                - Verbs should not be used in endpoint paths. Instead, the pathname should contain the nouns that identify the object that the endpoint that we are accessing or altering belongs to.
                    - Instead of using `/getAllClients` to fetch all clients, use `/clients`

                ### Singular vs Plural

                - Stick to one convention because it depends on your domain
                    - as an example
                        - **shopping cart** in e-commerce website is **1-to-1** relationship between client and a shopping cart. Therefore, it's confusing to have `/carts`
                        - on the other hand, we can have a **blog** with **articles** which makes more sense to have `/articles` endpoint

                ### Utilize Resource Nesting Efficiency

                - If resource have a **has-a** relationship to another resource it's good to use **nesting** while implementing REST API Contracts
                    - Example: user can have some orders in e-commerce website
                        - **user's orders**: `/users/1/orders/`
                        - **user's order**: `/users/1/orders/1`
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem value="rest-api-rest-verbs" label="REST Verbs">
                - **HEAD**
                    - identical to GET, except without the response body. It will do the same GET request but won't return anything
                    - useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request (download large file or response body)
                - **OPTIONS**
                    - return data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL
                - **PATCH**
                    - applied partial modification to the resource (send only username in the body) as opposed to POST which require the full user entity

                - query database when there is a cache miss

                ### Payload Compression

                - use gzip
                - reduce the data size to speed up the download/upload

                ### Connection Pool

                - opening and closing DB connections add significant overhead
                - connection pool maintains a number of open connections for applications to reuse

                ### Batching
