    **Glossary**

    - **Business Capability**: represents an organization's core competency, or
    what it's able to do to achieve strategic goals. It's a combination of
    people, processes, and technology that enables the organization to perform a
    specific task or function, essentially the "what" an organization can do.
    These capabilities are independent of the organization's structure,
    processes, and technology, and are the building blocks of the organization's
    strategy
    - **Business Capability Map**: visual representation that depicts
    the core functions or capabilities a business possesses and how they
    contribute to achieving its strategic goals. It provides a high-level
    understanding of what an organization can do and how its capabilities are
    structured

    **Benefits**

    - **Improving Strategic Planning**: align investments with strategic goals by showing strengths and weaknesses
    - **Aligning Business Units**: create a common language that breaks down silos and improves collaboration
    - **Identifying Gaps**: reveal deficiencies where new technology, staff, or processes are needed
    - **Streamlining Processes**: uncover redundancies, leading to reduced costs and better ROI
    - **Mitigating Risk**: highlight underdeveloped capabilities that pose a threat to critical functions
    - **Enhancing Communication**: provide a shared vocabulary to bridge the gap between business and IT

    - **Focus on Outcomes**: Define what a capability is in terms of the outcomes it achieves, rather than how those outcomes are produced
    - **Unique Intent**: Ensure that each capability is unique in its intent or purpose. There should be no ambiguity about what a specific capability aims to accomplish
    - **Single Instance**: A capability should exist once only within the organization. This prevents redundancy and ensures a single source of truth for each capability
    - **Avoid Overgeneralization**: Do not overgeneralize the business when defining capabilities. Be specific enough to accurately reflect the business's unique functions
    - **Business-Centric Language**: Use language and terminology that is appropriate and understood by the business stakeholders, avoiding technical jargon
    - **Define All Capabilities** (Ignore 80/20 Rule - Pareto Principle, suggests that roughly 80% of outcomes or effects come from 20% of the causes or inputs. This principle is often used in business to focus efforts on the most impactful activities and resources): If a Subject Matter Expert (SME) states that a task is rarely performed, still define it as a capability. The 80/20 rule doesn't apply here; a comprehensive map requires all capabilities
    - **Complete Business Description**: Your business's highest-level capabilities should provide a complete description of what your business does. Consider making your categories reflect key aspects of day-to-day operations for an accurate portrayal
    - **Non-Overlapping Capabilities**: You'll know you have good, non-overlapping capabilities when you can assign Level 2 capabilities without any confusion or debate
    - **Noun-Based Naming**: A capability is expressed as a noun (e.g., "Customer Management"), in contrast to a process, which is expressed as a verb (e.g., "Manage Customer")
    - **Stability Over Time**: Well-defined business capabilities don't change much over time, regardless of organizational shifts. The only exception is a substantial update to the organization's strategy
    - **Avoid Redundant Naming**: Avoid using the word "capability" at any level of the capability name itself (e.g., not "Customer Management Capability," just "Customer Management")
    - **Focus on Business Objects**: Focus on business objects as they provide a natural focal point for defining capabilities (e.g., "Product," "Customer," "Order")
    - **Organizational Structure Agnostic**: Don't stress too much about business units. Capabilities should stay the same and operate independently of the organization's current structure
    - **Maintain Appropriate Depth**: If you go too deep, the audience will be overwhelmed. Maintain a three-level distance between the highest level and the most detailed level for an accurate portrayal of your organization's breadth of capabilities, which is usually sufficient for IT landscape mapping
    - **Involve Strategy Stakeholders**: When developing your map, include those who define the strategies. When defining your company's capabilities at the top level, consider strategy as a primary factor
