## Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Aspect</th>
    <th>Linear Data Structures</th>
    <th>Non Linear Data Structures</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Arrangement of Data</td>
    <td>Data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other</td>
    <td>Data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Layer Presence</td>
    <td>All items are present on a single layer</td>
    <td>Data items are present at different layers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Traversability</td>
    <td>Can be traversed in a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all elements sequentially in a single pass</td>
    <td>Requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element, it might not be possible to traverse all elements in a single pass</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Memory Utilization</td>
    <td>Is not efficient</td>
    <td>Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time Complexity</td>
    <td>Increases with data size</td>
    <td>Remains the same</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Examples</td>
    <td>Arrays, Stack, Queue</td>
    <td>Tree, Graph, Map</td>
