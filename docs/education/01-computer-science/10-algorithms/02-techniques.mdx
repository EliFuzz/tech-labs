      <td><b>0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)</b></td>
      <td>
        Problem where you need to determine the most valuable combination of items to include in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. Items can either be included wholly (`1`) or not at all (`0`), hence the name `0/1`. The problem is solved using Dynamic Programming, a technique that breaks down complex problems into simpler subproblems. The solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem involves finding the optimal combinations for each possible weight limit up to the capacity of the knapsack, ensuring the maximum possible value is achieved

      <td><b>Backtracking</b></td>
      <td>
        Backtracking is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm used to solve computational problems by reversing steps when a solution is non-viable. It discards multiple solutions without fully examining them and continues by choosing another option until a solution is found or options are exhausted. It's efficient for large solution spaces (exponential), but can be inefficient if many partially built solutions are rejected

      <td>It's used to merge `k` number of sorted lists into 1 sorted list. It uses a min-heap or priority queue to efficiently combine the lists, resulting in a time complexity of `O(n log k)`, where `n` is the total number of elements and `k` is the number of sorted lists</td>

      <td>It's a technique that speeds up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls or computations and reusing them when the same inputs occur. It's particularly useful in problems with overlapping subproblems, like dynamic programming. Although it enhances performance, it can also increase memory usage due to the cached values. Therefore, it represents a trade-off between time and space complexity</td>
