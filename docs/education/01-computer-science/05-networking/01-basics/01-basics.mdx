# Networking: Basics

## Overview

<Tabs queryString="primary">
  <TabItem value="networking" label="Networking">
    The internet connects various computing devices globally. When accessing a website from a smartphone or laptop, the connection typically goes through a cellular tower, a router, and then to
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Packets are forwarded through local ISPs to the network hosting the website. Within the company network, packets pass through a link-layer switch to reach the
    appropriate server.

    Routers and link-layer switches are both packet switches responsible for forwarding packets. Routers are primarily used in the network core to connect multiple networks, while link-layer switches
    are utilized in access networks to connect multiple devices within a single network.
