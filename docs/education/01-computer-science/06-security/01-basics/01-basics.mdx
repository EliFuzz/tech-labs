# Security: Basics

## Overview

<Tabs queryString="primary">
  <TabItem value="overview" label="Overview">
  **Cybersecurity**, often referred to as information technology security or computer security, is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access, cyber attacks, damage, or theft. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard digital assets and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

  In essence, cybersecurity aims to mitigate the risks associated with cyber threats, which can include various forms of malicious activities such as hacking, malware, phishing, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering. These threats can target individuals, organizations, governments, or even entire nations, and they can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, privacy breaches, and disruption of critical services.

  **Key Components**

  - **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to determine the most effective strategies for mitigating them
